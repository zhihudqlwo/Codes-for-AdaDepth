# Codes-for-AdaDepth
This repository provides the implementation of our method for depth estimation of dynamic objects, achieving state-of-the-art performance on datasets like Cityscapes and Waymo Open. Our approach leverages intrinsic image information for robust and efficient depth estimation, requiring only 30 epochs for training without offline mask generation.
